# eryph guest services
This ISO contains the eryph guest services which allow you to connect
to your Hyper-V virtual machine via a Hyper-V socket without having
a working network connection.

## Installation
The guest services can be installed with the corresponding install
scripts: `install.ps1` for Windows and `install.sh` for Linux.
Please run the script as Administrator or root.

## Next steps
Please refer to the documentation. You will need to install our
companion tool `egs-tool` on the host to enable the integration.
